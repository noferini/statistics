\begin{abstract}
In this work a novel statistical approach is presented.
The aim of such an appraoch is to classify events associating a probability to belong to different classes in a way
which allows to classify simultaneoulsy events both in a statistical way and on event-by-event basis.
In particular two different startegies were derived in a similar framework: one using the Bayes' theorem properties
and one using the Quantium Mechanics formalism which treats, at statistical level, the usual finite detector resolution as a quantum
wave function effect.

\input{introduction}
The classification operation is a very general concept which may assume different meaning depending on the context in which
it is applied.
Here we are referring to the capability to discriminate different event classes on the basis of some
measured variables.
Because of a usual finite resolution in a single measurement different classes may be not completelly separable
in the sense that for a single event it is not possible to define with absolute certainty if it belongs to a class
or to another one.
In the case we are interested to perform measurement by selecting a specific event class there are usual two kinds of
approaches which can be exploited: a statistical approach which allows to unfold the finite resolution/spread of our
measurements to extract the number of event belonging to that class (for instance by fitting the distributions in the
variables we are able to measured); or defining some cuts on the variables which minimize the contamination of other classes.
In the first case we are able to extract the total number of events without, in principle, any efficiency loss and
contamination but we are not able to classify on event-by-event basis.
In the latter one we can associate each event to a class (useful to characterize the properties of the class in terms of
other variables/osservables) but we have to deal with corrections for efficiency loss and contamination.
The idea to associate a probability to each event is to extend the properties of the statistical approach, no
efficiency loss and no contamination by other classes, to the event-by-event approach by replacing the concept
of cut with the use of a  weight.
In this approach the probability used as a weight should guarantee that the effect of the contaminations by other
event classes goes to zero whena averaging on all the events.

In the first section we will present a general formalism to define probabilities under different assumptions
and to derive the properties in each scheme we presented.
In the second section we will focus on the two particular cases introduced before, Bayesian probabilities and Quantum probabilities,
extending the study to the multi-variable and multiple-classification scenarios.
In the third section some example will be reported to show the power and the limitations of the methods.
Finally, we will discuss our results reporting our conclusions and final remarks.
